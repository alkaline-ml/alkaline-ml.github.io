Currently a <strong>principal data scientist</strong> at State Farm. Previously worked as a <strong>senior data scientist</strong> (AT&T). 
In my current role, I have developed proprietary recommender systems from end-to-end, reduced claims cycle times using text analytics, and used unsupervised learning techniques to identify internal security threats.

Obtained my MS in <strong>Business Analytics</strong> from the <a href="https://www.mccombs.utexas.edu/Master-of-Science-in-Business-Analytics">McComb's School of Business</a> at the University of Texas at Austin and my Bachelor's in <strong>Psychology</strong> from 
Texas A&M University. My masters capstone (thesis) project involved developing a bespoke visual analytics platform for Boeing.

<span class="fa fa-code-fork about-icon"></span>
When I'm not writing machine learning models & software at work, chances are I'm writing code for a side project at home. Some of my more notable side projects include an <a href="https://github.com/tgsmith61591/pyramid"><strong>auto-ARIMA library for Python</strong></a>, an an extensive <a href="https://github.com/tgsmith61591/clust4j">clustering library for Java</a>.
